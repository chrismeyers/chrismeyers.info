+ The site uses a few open source tools and frameworks:
  * [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as a fontend Javascript framework.
  * [Aqueduct](https://aqueduct.io/) as a backend API framework.
  * [fancyBox3](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) to make viewing images a lot more pleasant.
  * [hamburgers](https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/) to animate the hamburger menu icon.
